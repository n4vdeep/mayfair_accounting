                <p>You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Request access to information relating to you (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Click here to make a subject access request.</li>
                  <li>Request correction of information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</li>
                  <li>Request erasure of information relating to you. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information relating to you where there is no good reason for us continuing to deal with it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove information relating to you where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase information relating to you to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                  <li>Object to processing of information relating to you where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing information relating to you for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                  <li>Request restriction of processing of information relating to you. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of information relating to you in the following scenarios:
                    <ul>
                      <li>if you want us to establish accuracy of the information;</li>
                      <li>where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                      <li>where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                      <li>o	you have objected to our use of the information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Request the transfer of information relating to you to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, information relating to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                  <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process information relating to you. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
